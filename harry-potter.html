    <h3 class="hp1">Harry Potter</h3>
    <p class="hp2">
      Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author
      J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry
      Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are
      students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc
      concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who
      intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as
      the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical
      people). Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the
      Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense
      popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have
      attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often
      considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[2] As of
      February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide,
      making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been
      translated into eighty languages.[3] The last four books consecutively set
      records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment
      selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million
      copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.
