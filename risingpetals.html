        Rising Petals
    </h3>
        <p class="r2">
            Rising Petals – an English anthology of poems by Odisha’s Ashwini Rath is a book suitable for all tastes. There aren’t many English poets from Odisha in the country and amidst that, Rising Petals by Ashwini is a worthy representation. 

Rising Petals is a compilation of 26 poems that don’t follow a specific theme or flow and come to the reader at the will of the author. But the lack of a stringing theme that is otherwise common in such anthologies doesn’t diminish the charm of the poems. Rath’s work reads like the work of a romantic and yet, there is no romance in it. It’s not a traditional love anthology but there is a closeness and fondness for life and lived experiences along with what the poet aspires about.
