      House of Cards is a political thriller novel by British author Michael
      Dobbs. Published in 1989, it tells the story of Francis Urquhart, a
      fictional Chief Whip of the Conservative Party, and his amoral and
      manipulative scheme to become leader of the governing party and, thus,
      Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. A television adaptation, written by
      Andrew Davies and produced by the BBC was aired in 1990. A six-part radio
      adaptation of the first novel, written by Neville Teller aired on BBC
      Radio 4 in 1996.[1] In 2013, the serial and the Dobbs novel were the basis
      for a US television adaptation set in Washington, D.C., commissioned and
      released by Netflix.
